Real-world verified network firewall

DSLAB has developed techniques to automatically formally verify software network functions, which are pieces of software that implement network functionality. As part of this work, we developed basic versions of functions such as a firewall and an Ethernet bridge, but they are not complete enough to be used in a real network. How much more effort would it take to build a realistic firewall that can be used on a real network, such as by using HTTP or SSH through it?

In this project, you will:

- Define a minimal viable set of features that realistic firewalls must have
- Extend an existing firewall with these features
- Formally verify this firewall
- Deploy this firewall on a real network

You will learn:
 - Low-level networking concepts
 - Formal verification concepts
